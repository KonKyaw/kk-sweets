TLDR: Building up from the previous WardrobeInventory, I have created a functional website! Feel free to look around and tell me what you think!<br>

# Description

**What is this?**: A webapp where the shop owner (me) can display a catalog of Myanmar Traditional Desserts, where the potential customers can learn about them: the price, description in different languages and ingredients (allergens). Hopefully, it will be useful and convenient for shop owners, and create an interesting and pleasant experience for visitors.<br>
_Version: 1.0_

##  Technical Features:
- **Angular Typescript frontend**
  - Responsive: try viewing from different devices (mobile, pc) to see the differences!
 
- **Firebase backend and Hosting**
  - Hosting: set up different projects and environments with the same code, for testing, public and personal uses
  - Storage: store data files such as product images, similar to S3 on AWS
  - Realtime Database: faster storage for data such as product and order details
  - Authentication: Google Authentication
- **Google Analytics**: I have only connected the website to analytics, since the current webapp is very simple and does not have any conversion events.
- **GitHub**: I havenâ€™t added any more files to .gitignore, since I mostly intend this for my personal use. For firebase credentials, you can apply security rules.
  
## UI
- **Catalog Page (Home page)**: A catalog view with filter on each category.
    - Bootstrap Navbar with user details such as name and avatar
    - Custom favicon and logos
    - Product card view which also leads to Details/ Edit page
    - Language Switcher: I have added the feature to add multi-language descriptions and view them accordingly.
- **Dashboard Page (Admin only)**: A dashboard view that shows all the items and information. Intended for admin user only.
    - Keyword search filter
    - Angular Material Table with pagination, sorting
    - Future plans: order management, dashboard visualizations to understand inventory stats at a glance
- **Product Details/ Edit Page**:
    - Reactive Form that applies a flexible mixture of select and input elements for data input
    - Validations and Errors to guide users and format input data
    - Image upload from image URL or direct image upload
    - Product Card preview which is also used in Catalog page
      
## Final Remarks
- **Version Compatibility**: this project started from the [Angular online course by Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/angular-master-class). His course structure and project idea, which was originally a online shopping platform, are fine but the course was already 5 years old. So, a lot of codes and packages that are in the course are already deprecated, but I wanted to use more up-to-date ones. This meant big obstacles every step of the way, but also more rewarding at the same time.
- **Firebase vs Angularfire**: there is a whole separate set of packages for angular called angularfire. It is based on vanilla firebase but things got complicated pretty quick when you try to find your way through things, and mix up the similar commands between the two.
- Almost every detailed behaviour is intended: they are working like this probably because I have tried hard to code them in that way.
- Let me know what you think! Please leave your comments in [the discussions](https://github.com/KonKyaw/wardrobe-inventory/discussions) or on [my LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/kaung-kyaw-414116147). It would be very helpful for me and much appreciated!

# Development

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. Add `--configuration production` for production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `firebase deploy -P prod` to deploy the build to a firebase project with an alias named `prod`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
